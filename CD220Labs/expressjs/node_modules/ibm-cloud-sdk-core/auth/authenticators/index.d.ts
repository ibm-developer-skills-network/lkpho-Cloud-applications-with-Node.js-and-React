/**
 * @module authenticators
 * The ibm-cloud-sdk-core module supports the following types of authentication:
 *
 * Basic Authentication
 * Bearer Token
 * Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 * Container (IKS, etc)
 * VPC Instance
 * Cloud Pak for Data
 * No Authentication
 *
 * The supported authentication types may vary from service to service. Each
 * authentication type is implemented as an Authenticator for consumption by a service.
 *
 * classes:
 *   AuthenticatorInterface: Implement this class to provide custom authentication schemes to services.
 *   Authenticator: Extend this class to provide custom authentication schemes to services.
 *   BasicAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing supplied basic authentication information to service endpoint.
 *   BearerTokenAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing supplied bearer token to service endpoint.
 *   CloudPakForDataAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing CP4D authentication information to service endpoint.
 *   IAMAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing IAM authentication information to service endpoint.
 *   ContainerAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing IAM authentication to a service, based on a token living on the container.
 *   VpcInstanceAuthenticator: Authenticator that uses the VPC Instance Metadata Service API to retrieve an IAM token.
 *   NoAuthAuthenticator: Performs no authentication. Useful for testing purposes.
