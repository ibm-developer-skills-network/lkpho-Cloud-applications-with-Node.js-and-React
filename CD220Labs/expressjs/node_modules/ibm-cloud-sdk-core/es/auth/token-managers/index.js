/**
 * @module token-managers
 * The ibm-cloud-sdk-core module supports the following types of token authentication:
 *
 * Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 * Cloud Pak for Data
 * Container (IKS, etc)
 * VPC Instance
 *
 * The token managers sit inside of an authenticator and do the work to retrieve
 * tokens where as the authenticators add these tokens to the actual request.
 *
 * classes:
 *   IamTokenManager: Token Manager of IAM via apikey.
 *   Cp4dTokenManager: Token Manager of CloudPak for data.
 *   ContainerTokenManager: Token manager of IAM via compute resource token.
 *   VpcInstanceTokenManager: Token manager of VPC Instance Metadata Service API tokens.
 *   JwtTokenManager: A class for shared functionality for parsing, storing, and requesting JWT tokens.
